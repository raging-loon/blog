## `rtl::copy_on_write`

Copy-on-Write (COW) is an optimization technique in which multiple objects might share a piece of data; when one of them attempts to modify that data, a copy is created.

Here is a visual example:
```C++

using int_cow = rtl::copy_on_write<int>;

int_cow x;
int_cow y = x;
int_cow z = y;

// All three objects point to the same buffer
// this assertion would not fail
assert(x.reference() == y.reference() == z.reference());

x.resize(10);

// y and z have been implicitly resized

y.resize(20);

// y creates a copy of x's buffer, resizes it, and sets itself as the owner
// now z points to y's buffer

*(z.at_c(0)) = 1;

// z now copies y's buffer and modifies it

// this assertion would not fail:
assert(x.reference() != y.reference() != z.reference());
```

## Usage
This will primarily be used as a backend for the various other template classes such as `rtl::unordered_map` and `rtl::string`
