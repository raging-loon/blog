## Radium Template Library
RTL is a replacement for STL (not to be confused with Window's RunTime Library).

This contains the following template classes:
- [`rtl::copy_on_write`](/blog/rtl/2024/07/08/COW.html)
- `rtl::basic_string`
- `rtl::string`
- `rtl::wstring`
- `rtl::array`
- `rtl::function`
- `rtl::shared_ptr`
- `rtl::unique_ptr`
- `rtl::hash_map`

Note that it belong to the `rtl` namespace and is using the lower_snake_case convention. This is to a) easy the amount of typing (as opposed to `radium::rtl::xyz`) and b) to indicate that it belonds to the core. Everything that is not part of the core engine will be in CamelCase (e.g. `oglRenderDriver` or `ShaderFactory`)
